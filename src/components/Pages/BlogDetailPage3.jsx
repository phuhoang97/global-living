									Exciting start-up scene, Exciting job
									opportunities
								</p>
								<p>
									For those looking to get in on the ground
									level of industry, Hungary is the home of an
									exciting start-up scene, making it an ideal
									location for business students and those
									with an entrepreneurial spirit. Over the
									past few years, Hungary has been home to a{" "}
									<a
										href="https://www.failory.com/startups/hungary"
										className="text-blue-500 underline"
										target="_blank"
									>
										plethora of successful start-ups, some
										worth billions
									</a>
									.
								</p>
								<p>
									The major urban areas are of course where
									jobs are more plentiful for expats hoping to
									work in Hungary. Larger cities such as
									Budapest, Miskolc and Debrecen have good
									employment opportunities.
								</p>
								<p>
									In Budapest, the financial sector is
									considered one of the best-developed, and in
									fact the city ranks as one of the primary
									regional economies in the European Union.
									There is also a rapidly developing
									technology sector, and if you have skills as
									a developer in this area you are likely to
									find work in Budapest. The city is one of
									the Top 100 performing cities in the world
									in terms of GDP.
								</p>
								<p>
									As one of the largest cities in Hungary,
									Budapest is also the economic center of the
									country, with many international brands
									calling it their homes there are plenty of
									opportunities. District Five is the core of
									business in Budapest, with many important
									businesses, the Parliament Buildings and
									ministries. However, if you’re looking for
									something more mixed, Slovak is your city,
									with more cosmopolitan businesses like bars,
									restaurants, shops and clubs.
								</p>
								<p>
									Outside the cities, work in these sectors is
									likely to become less plentiful – but work
									still exists for expatriates. Teaching
									English in rural locations is something that
									many people do, and work of this type is
									welcomed into the country.
								</p>
								<p>
									Trong những năm vừa qua, nền kinh tế Hungary
									đã dần đổi sắc, trở thành một thị trường
									startup sôi động với sự xuất hiện liên tiếp
									của hàng loạt những công ty khởi nghiệp và
									rất nhiều trong số đó trị giá đến hàng tỷ đô
									la. Vậy nên không quá lời khi khẳng định
									rằng Hungary chính là điểm khởi đầu lý tưởng
									cho những ai có khao khát dựng xây doanh
									nghiệp của riêng mình.
								</p>
								<p>
									Cơ hội việc làm tại Hungary cũng rất đa
									dạng, đặc biệt là tại những vùng đô thị lớn
									như Budapest, Miskolc và Debrecen. Trong đó,
									Thủ đô Budapest là thành phố lớn nhất, đồng
									thời là trung tâm kinh tế - chính trị của cả
									đất nước.
								</p>
								<p>
									Tại Budapest, ngành kinh tế được coi là lĩnh
									vực phát triển bậc nhất, thậm chí được đánh
									giá là một trong những vùng kinh tế trọng
									điểm của Liên minh Eu. Bởi vậy nên sẽ không
									khó để tìm được những doanh nghiệp quốc tế
									lớn mạnh tại Budapest với môi trường làm
									việc chuyên nghiệp cùng cơ hội trau dồi
									trình độ chuyên môn. Mảng kỹ thuật công nghệ
									cũng đang trên đà tăng trưởng mạnh mẽ, do đó
									nhu cầu tuyển dụng cũng sẽ cao hơn.
								</p>
								<p>
									Là một trong những thành phố đẹp nhất Châu
									u, du lịch Budapest cũng là một trong những
									địa hạt có đóng góp mạnh mẽ cho nền kinh tế
									Hungary.

									Affordable tuition fees
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the biggest obstacles for students
									wishing to achieve a higher education is
									trying to figure out how to pay astronomical
									tuition fees. Therefore, you might find an
									education to be much more achievable
									financially in Hungary. Medical school in
									particular can leave students with massive
									amounts of student loans, but that isn’t the
									case in Hungary.
								</p>
								<p>
									A medical degree from a university in
									Hungary is recognized by the European Union
									and the United States, which brings many
									international students to study medicine in
									Hungary, meaning you can get an excellent
									education without breaking the bank. Medical
									students can anticipate spending about
									$16,500 annually for a six-year degree.
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the most prestigious medical schools
									in the country is one of the ten faculties
									of the first Hungarian university, the{" "}
									<a
										href="https://international.pte.hu/"
										className="text-blue-500 underline"
										target="_blank"

										University of Pécs
									</a>
									. More than 3,500 students from over 80
									countries study in the Hungarian, English
									and German programs at the{" "}

									in 2024, the former will celebrate its 40th
									and the latter its 20th birthday.

									, the Medical School also offers a master
									program in Biotechnology, PhD, and
									specialist training in 33 specialties. Its

									September 2021, trains professionals with an
									interdisciplinary approach to solving
									technical problems at the

									, launched in September 2022 at the Faculty
									of Pharmacy in Pécs, is unique in Hungary in
									that it is taught exclusively in English and
									offers globally sought-after knowledge, a
									variety of career paths and concrete
									industrial experience during studies. For
									those wishing to refresh their secondary
									school knowledge in biology, chemistry and
									physics, the faculty offers preparatory
									courses in English and German.
								</p>
								<p>
									A major attraction of the medical school of
									South Transdanubia is that the diploma
									obtained there can be applied in many
									countries of the world, and with the
									accreditation according to the criteria of
									the World Federation for Medical Education
									(WFME) in 2022, the Pécs diploma will be
									naturalizable in the USA after 2024.

									High-quality education
								</p>

								<p>
									Attending a university in Hungary may be
									more affordable than some other countries,
									but that doesn’t mean you’re going to be
									sacrificing quality. Hungary complies with
									European standards and medical studies in
									Hungary are considered to be of the highest
									quality. This means the degree you earn
									studying abroad will be viable in the UK and
									on American soil. “Of course, the studies
									were not easy. But that’s what you want from
									your doctor; to be tested against the
									highest standards. The education I received
									is easily on par with all healthcare systems
									I saw so far,” Alan Abada M.D. said of his
									medical education in Hungary.
								</p>
								<p>
									High-quality education, the transfer of
									marketable knowledge at the highest possible
									level, is particularly important for medical
									schools, where universities invest a lot of
									resources. In September 2021, the new
									ultramodern theoretical block at the
									University of Pécs, which is both a research
									and teaching wing, was inaugurated. The
									12,000-square-metre complex features four
									large lecture theatres and 34 seminar rooms
									equipped with ICT-enhanced teaching
									facilities, as well as Core Facility spaces
									designed along the lines of the "lab within
									a lab" principle, meeting the highest
									standards of medical research.
								</p>
								<p>
									The highly practice-oriented dental training
									is supported by an almost 3,000-square-metre
									building in Pécs, inaugurated in the summer
									of 2022. Around 1 billion forint ($2.737m)
									is being invested in the renewal of the
									Simulation Training Centre, which, with more
									than 1500 contact hours per semester, has
									now become a national leader in the
									practical training of doctors and healthcare
									professionals. The Szentágothai Research
									Centre, also located in Pécs, the university
									town of South Transdanubia, is one of the
									most modern research centres in Central
									Europe, bringing together dozens of research
									groups and hundreds of experts in five main
									research clusters (neuroscience, molecular,
									building energy, immunology and
									physico-chemistry). The Virology National
									Laboratory of the University of Pécs, which
									has been operating since September 2020, is
									a BSL-4 level research laboratory, the most
									modern research unit in the Central European
									region, meeting all the laboratory
									technology, biosafety and safety
									requirements of the time. The National
									Laboratory of Human Reproduction, also in
									Pécs, aims to increase the number of
									successful infertility treatments by
									improving the efficiency of artificial
									insemination techniques.

									While you're going on a study abroad
									adventure, most of your time is spent
									meeting people and consequently spending
									time with the ones you like. One of the best
									things you can do as an foreign student in
									Hungary is to make Hungarian friends who
									welcome newcomers with wide-open arms. The
									Hungarian people come from a diverse
									collection of backgrounds, so there’s a
									place for everyone. And if you want to meet
									people from different backgrounds, you might
									want to go to one of many concerts and music
									festivals that are regularly organized,
									where you can meet plenty of expats.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you're a party animal and love hanging
									out with your friends, you will definitely
									enjoy Budapest. Budapest is one of the best
									destinations if partying is what you do. Its
									party scenes thrive thanks to its diversity
									and variety of clubbing options for any
									taste. The city is considered to be one of
									the best party destinations in Europe. It
									has a vibrant nightlife that offers
									something for everyone. Whether you are
									looking for hipster bars, touristy clubs, or

								</p>
								<p>
									Budapest, with its size and population of
									around two million, has undeniable
									advantages in terms of entertainment,
									culture, gastronomy and leisure. But there
									is no doubt that liveability and
									accessibility is a feature of rural
									university towns: public transport does not
									take hours out of your life, and you can hop
									on your bike and be on campus, in the city
									centre. Since many of the foreign students
									at the Medical School in Pécs also cycle,
									there are plenty of new bike storage
									facilities on campus, but you can also
									easily walk to the medical school from the
									surrounding dormitories, which are within

									Buda Castle.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Hungarian capital is a cultural hotspot
